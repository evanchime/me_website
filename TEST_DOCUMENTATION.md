## Running Tests

### Run All Tests
```bash
# Using the test runner script
./run_tests.sh

# Or manually with the settings module
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="me_website_project.settings_test"
cd me_website_project
python manage.py test
```

### Run Specific App Tests
```bash
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="me_website_project.settings_test"
cd me_website_project

# Test specific app
python manage.py test accounts.tests
python manage.py test features.tests

# Test specific test class
python manage.py test accounts.tests.LoginFormTests
python manage.py test accounts.tests.SignupViewTests
```

### Run Project-Wide Tests
```bash
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="me_website_project.settings_test"
cd me_website_project

# Integration tests
python manage.py test tests_integration

# Health check tests
python manage.py test tests_health_check

# Form validation tests
python manage.py test tests_forms
```

### Run Tests with Verbose Output
```bash
python manage.py test -v 2
```

## Recent Improvements

### Email Validation
- Email field is now properly required in the SignUpForm
- Tests have been updated to verify email field validation
- Empty email addresses are now correctly rejected

### Test Naming
- Test method names have been updated to accurately reflect what they're testing
- `test_already_authenticated_signup_redirect` renamed to `test_already_authenticated_signup_view`
- `test_already_authenticated_redirect` renamed to `test_already_authenticated_login_view`

### Test Documentation
- Improved docstrings for test methods
- Updated comments to reflect actual behavior
- Better descriptions of test purposes and expectations

## Test Scenarios Covered

### Authentication & Authorization
- User registration with required email validation
- Login with case-insensitive username
- Password reset workflow
- Session management with "remember me" functionality

### Form Validation
- Login form validation
- Registration form with required fields
- Password strength checking
- Email format and uniqueness validation

### View Functionality
- Authentication views (login, signup, password change/reset)
- Content display views
- Template usage and context variables
- HTTP status codes and redirects

### Security
- CSRF protection verification
- SQL injection prevention tests
- XSS attack prevention
- Input validation and sanitization

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Test Independence**: Each test is self-contained
2. **Descriptive Names**: Test method names clearly indicate purpose
3. **Detailed Assertions**: Specific verification of expected behavior
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests for both positive and negative cases
5. **Security Focus**: Tests for security vulnerabilities

## Test Summary

The 294 tests in this suite provide comprehensive coverage of the me_website Django project. All tests are now passing, including the updated tests for email field validation and authenticated user behavior. The test suite serves as a robust foundation for maintaining code quality and preventing regressions during future development.
